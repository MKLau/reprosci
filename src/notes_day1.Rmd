![Wordcloud pre-class comments](../docs/cloud_2018.png)

This is a diagram exploring the comments made by workshop participants
regarding what they hope to gain from the course. A few things that
stood out in looking this over:

- People wanted to learn **R** (Kaboom, my mind explodes!)
- A lot of interest in statistical analysis. Although we won't have
time to actually cover staistical analyses, this class will enable
folks to learn and implement new stats methods on their own.
- Everyone had something that they wanted to learn how to do. Although
there will be a wide range of abilities in this class, everyone can
look at this as an opportunity to learn something.

# Overview

- Day 1: Motiviation and framework for scientific reproducibility and
  the basics of using **R** in *RStudio*
- Day 2: Scientific scripts and best practics for code and projects
- Day 3: Tools for keeping track of versions and code dependencies

## Being a good code community member (5 min)

We're about to start an activity, and it should be collaborative. If
you don't understand something, try to figure it out and then ask the
internet or someone else participating in the workshop (like me!). To
make sure that we foster an open, productive and safe community
everyone participating in this course will follow the Code of Conduct
outline by the folks at ROpenSci (https://ropensci.org/coc/).

Similar to science in general software development is empowered by
community. Please contribute to this by, in particular:

- *We all get out of this class what we put into it.*
- *Be considerate and respectiful of each other in speech and actions.*
- *Contribute a safe and effective learning experience for everyone.*

Also, please take a look at the Ada Initiative webpage for more
information about creating an inclusive coding community:

# Day 1

## Overview: Why make your work reproducible and why R? (15 min)

Science is driven by the exchange of information and
knowledge. Currently, there is a lot that we can do to make research
more transparent and useful. A recent study (Stodden *et al.* 2018)
demonstrated that only 26% of studies published in *Science* could be
reproduced. This was even more striking given that the study was
conducted after the *Science* had instituted it's open data policy.

What this and other studies point to is the need to provide well
documented data as well as the software that were needed to conduct
the study. Luckily, advances in open-source computer languages, such
as **R** and **python**, provide a way to produce computations that
can more easily document scientific research in a transparent, easily
shared way.

In this course, we will cover how to conduct **reproducible**
scientific research using the **R** programming language and
supporting software that will enable researchers to more clearly and
easily document projects. Participants will gain experience coding in
**R** using the *RStudio* IDE and the *git* version control system.

Possible additional topics, if time and interest allows:

- *RMarkdown* 
- *dplyr*
- *ggplot*
- *github*
- *Shiny Apps*
- *R packages*
- *Continuous Integration (e.g. Travis)*
- *Posting data to web archives (e.g. Figshare)*
- *Open Licensing*
- *Code performance with profVis*
- *Data Provenance in R* 
- *Code cleaning with Rclean*

# Reproducibility Framework (10 min)

**Max(reproducibility) = Data * Software * Documentation**

1. Setup your project so that there is a clear architecture (*RStudio*)
2. Work so that your computation from initial data to finished results
will be coded (wherever possible), including data cleaning and
processing steps (**R**)
3. Keep track of versions of your code (*git*)
4. Make initial data available (whenever possible, *git*)
5. Keep track of software dependencies (*packrat*, *git*)
5. Be organized, succinct in style, coding and documentation (**R**,
   *Markdown*, *formatR*)

If you're interested in more details on how to conduct reproducible
research, see the **TEE** (Transparency in Ecology and Evolution)
website http://www.ecoevotransparency.org/ and the **FAIR**
reproducible research guide at
https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/.


## RStudio Tour (10 min)

To use RStudio, you will need to download and install both of the following:

1. **R** https://cran.r-project.org/
2. *RStudio* https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download/


I highly recommend referring to RStudio's *Cheat Sheets*, especially
for using RStudio and basics of R.

- https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/

## R and RStudio

**R** is a statistical programming language. It is just text that
follows specific rules that a computer can interpret as "things" that
it is supposed to do.

*RStudio* provides an interface to R and other tools. 

Here are some of the parts of *RStudio*:

## Console

The Console is a window that can be used to "speak" R directly to the
computer. It has a little ">" symbol that indicates where you can
enter code (where the cursor is) and the code that you have already
run (above where the cursor is). This is a handy place to conduct
tasks that you don't want to keep for later usage.

## Script(s)

Scripts are text files whose syntax follows the specifications of a
programming language. Usually scripts are code that is aimed at doing
a bunch of tasks, like analyze some data and produce output. 

## The "Workbench"

A set of windows (usually to the right of the Console and Scripts)
with useful tools from *RStudio*. There are many possible tabs that
could occur here. These are some of the possbiliites:

- **Environment** shows you what "data" you currently have loaded into
**R**'s memory
- **History** shows you what you've done with **R**
- **Files** is a tab that will show you the files in your system
- **Plot** shows plots that you have generated
- **Help** will allow you to search for topics specific to the **R**
language
- **Packages** we'll get to this later, but this is a way to add-on to
the functionality of **R**
- **Viewer** similar to the *Plot* tab, this will show you a data
  table 


## Activity: Example Project (15 min)

Download, unzip and open up the example project in RStudio, check your
working directory and run the *basics.R* script.

https://github.com/HarvardForest/repro_example

1. Click the "Clone or download" button and choose "Download ZIP"
2. Un-zip the repository using your system's unzip tool (often this
can be accessed by right-clicking on the Zip)
3. Open R-Studio
4. From the "File" menu, choose "Open Project" and navigate to the
unzipped project and click "Open"
5. Run the script 
6. Make sure that the working directory is set to the project
directory (search the *RStudio* help system for "Set Working Directory")

## What is the Working Directory?

The *working directory* is a specific directory location in your file
system that you can set in **R**'s memory. Having this makes life a
lot easier in many ways, but the main one is that it allows **R** to
make assumptions about the files that you're referring to in your
code.

# It's time to take a break! (10 min)

<!-- 60 min -->

## Anatomy of an R Script (10 min)

Let's look a little more closely at basics.R

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Basic R script

# MK Lau

# 15 April 2018

dat <- read.csv(file = "./data/data.csv")

cor.test(dat[,"x"], dat[,"y"])

plot(y ~ x, data = dat)
```


What do you notice about it?

Here are some general things that this script represents for scripts
in **R** generally:

1. It is ordered such that the code at the top should be run before
the code lower in the script
2. Code that is to the right of hashes ("#") is not executed
3. There are commands (aka. functions) that are followed by an open
parenthesis, then some more words and then a close parenthesis
4. Typically data analysis workflow consists of read-in, wrangle and
then analyze data
5. **R** is similar to English, so if you want to do something (like
plot some data) it is often similar to what you think it might be

## Function Anatomy

1. Function have names, like "plot", "mean", "help", etc.
2. Information (aka. "arguments") are given to objects inside of
parentheses
3. Arguments are defined using equal signs ("=") and separated by
   commas (",")

Note that arguments **usually** exist only inside of functions, so you
can't access the information inside of functions unless it's
specifically passed out of that function.

Also, functions can have many arguments. Functions have to define
default settings and orderings for arguments. Because of this, you
don't always have to tell a function the value of every argument and
you don't always have to define an argument by name with an equal
sign. 

## Objects and Assignments

**Objects** are a used to tell **R** that some data should be kept in its
working memory that can be called by that objects name, as in "dat" in
the above example.

**Assignments** are used to create objects with data. This is done in
  the above example with the "<-" (aka. left arrow). There are lots of
  other ways to conduct assignments, including "=", but the left arrow
  is generally the best to use for code clarity. 

## Getting help with R

Now that you have a basic understanding of functions and arguments,
you can expand on your **R** vocab by trial and error and getting
help. Here are some useful ways to get help:

- *?*, *??*, *help*
- Google ("How do I _____ in R?")
- Community (This is not a a test, this is life)

## Review and Q/A (10 min)

1. Importance of reproducibility
2. Max(reproduciblity) = data * software * docs
3. RStudio
4. R language (Arguments, Functions, Scripts)
5. Getting help
