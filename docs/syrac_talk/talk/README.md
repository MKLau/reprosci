Technical Solutions to Advance Evaluation and Replication in the
Social Sciences: What’s New, What's Next

Workshop Overview and Agenda

Wednesday, August 29, 2018 | 9:00am to 3:00pm
Exeter Room, Marriott Copley Place Hotel, Boston, MA
Organizers: Data-PASS Alliance (http://www.data‐pass.org/)


Recent findings of low levels of reproducibility in research has been
a wake-up call to scientists. In addition to the challenges of making
study details and data and metadata available and accessible, the
rapid rise of custom analytical software (such as R, MatLab and Python
scripts) is quickly becoming a significant challenge as well. Such
analytical scripts that are used in scientific research are often
informal, written without following software best practices. This is
leading to a proliferation of irreproducbile software. Given the
realities of the demands placed on scientists, we have investigated
the use of "data provenance" (i.e. a formalized record of a
computational process) to produce tools to help researchers improve
the transparency and reproducibility of analytical software associated
with a research project. This talk will present the concept of data
provenance and how it has been applied to create tools, such as an
automatic project "capsule" creation program (encapsulator) and a code
cleaning package for R (Rclean), to aid in the process of sharing
research through public project repositories like Dataverse.
