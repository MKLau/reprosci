Module: reproducible scientific analysis

Science is driven by the exchange of information and
knowledge. Writing code not only let's researchers rapidly access a
broad set of analytical tools, if done well, it can also make sharing
data, analyses and findings easier.

This course teaches you how to conduct scientific research using the R
programming language using the core software best practices and tools
to make it easier to preserve and share your project.

Total Class Time: 4.5 hours

## Why program, why use R and why make your work reproducible? (30 min)

- **FAIR** = Findable Accessible Interoperable Reproducible


## Reproducibility Framework 

- DEMO: R power

- Activity: make a plot using the RStudio IDE
- Activity: text completion and syntax highlighting
- Activity: script vs command line

## Being a good code community member (10 min)

- https://odsc.com/code-of-conduct

## Data wrangling (30 min)

- DEMO: script vs spreadsheet

- Activity: import a dataset (read.csv)
- Activity: manage the data for an analysis (order, sort, grep)
- Activity: lubridate
- Activity: testing data (typos, coersion, fixing)

For Further Study:

- *dplyr* reorganize data
- *stringr* manipulate text (aka. "strings")
- *lubridate* for handling dates and times
- *purrr* "apply" functions = functions for repeating functions

## Notebooks are dead, long live notebooks! (45 min)

- DEMO: RMarkdown notebook

- Activity: organize prvious code into chunks
- Activity: journal your process in your notebook

## Managing the Workspace (30 min)

Where should you store your data and how should you reference it in
your script?

- DEMO: sharing a script

- Activity: playing with relative paths
- Activity: accessing data on the web

## "Backing Up" Version Control (1 hour)

In this module, you'll learn how to use git and github from RStudio. 

- DEMO: versioning


## Data Provenance (45 min)

- DEMO: Rclean

- Activity: clean up some code with cleanR
- Activity: create a project capsule with encapsulator
