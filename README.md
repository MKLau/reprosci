Reproducible Research in R
===========================

# Why make your work reproducible and why R? 

Science is driven by the exchange of information and knowledge. A
recent study demonstrated that only 26% of studies published in the
journal *Science* could be reproduced (see Stodden *et al.*
2018). This was even more striking given that the study was conducted
after *Science* had instituted its open data policy. Luckily, advances
in open-source computer languages, such as **R**, provide a way to
produce computations that can more easily document scientific research
in a transparent, easily shared way.
